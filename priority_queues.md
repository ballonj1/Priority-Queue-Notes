## Priority Queues
Ex. Computer is capable of running multiple applications at the same time.  The effect is typically achieved by assigning a priority to events associated with the application.  Cellphones are likely to process an incoming call over a particular app.  The priority queue should provide the functionality to remove the maximum and insert.

Uses
1. Can be used as the basis of a sorting algorithm by inserting a sequence of items and then removing the smallest item one by one.
2. Building block for other algorithms.

API
1. Remove the max/min
2. Insert
3. Constructor
4. Compare

## Elementary implementations
1. We can use an array or linked list (ordered or unordered)
